## Removing members

The sidebar we just implemented has an obvious draw-back -- there's no way to remove members. In typical RESTful style, removing a member is achieved by deleting a membership. What we'd like is a delete button on each card that removes the membership. That means what we really want are *Membership* cards in the sidebar (at the moment they are User cards). So, in `projects/show.dryml`, change:
