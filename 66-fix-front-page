## Final steps

From: Bryan Larsen <bryan@larsen.st>

There's just a couple of things to do to round this part of the tutorial off. Firstly, you might have noticed there's no place to create a new project at the moment. There's also no place that list "Projects you have joined". We'll add both of those to the front page, in the place we currently have a list of "Your projects". Replace that entire `<section class="content-body">` with the following DRYML:

SHOW_PATCH

Notice how we set the context on the entire section to be the current user (`with="&current_user"`). That makes the markup inside the section much more compact and easy to read.
