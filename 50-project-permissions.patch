project-permissions

From: Bryan Larsen <bryan@larsen.st>

How should this affect the permissions? Certain operations on the project should probably be restricted to its owner. We'll use the `owner_is?` helper (that Hobo provides for every `belongs_to` relationship) as it can save an extra database hit. So, edit these permission methods in the Project model:

SHOW_PATCH

Note that in the `create_permitted?` method, we assert that `owner_is? acting_user`. This is very often found in conjunction with `:creator => true`. Together, these mean that the current user can create their own projects only, and the "Owner" form field will be automatically removed from the new project form.
